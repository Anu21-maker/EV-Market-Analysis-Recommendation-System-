# Course 5 - Data Science Project

This repository contains the project submitted as part of **Course 5**. The project demonstrates the application of data science methodologies to solve a real-world problem using Python-based tools and techniques.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `project.pdf` ‚Äì Final report containing methodology, analysis, results, and conclusions.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Define the problem statement clearly.
- Collect and explore relevant data.
- Clean, preprocess, and analyze the data.
- Apply appropriate models or techniques.
- Evaluate and interpret the results.
- Document findings and insights.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Scikit-learn / XGBoost / other ML libraries (if applicable)
- PDF report compiled using LaTeX or Word

## üß† Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   Identify and import a suitable dataset for the problem domain.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualize and explore the dataset to find trends, patterns, or anomalies.

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Handle missing values, normalize/encode variables, and prepare data for modeling.

4. **Model Building**  
   Choose and apply appropriate statistical or machine learning models.

5. **Evaluation**  
   Measure model performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.).

6. **Conclusion**  
   Summarize key insights and recommendations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can review the final report by opening the `project.pdf` file. If code or data files are added later, follow the steps below:
